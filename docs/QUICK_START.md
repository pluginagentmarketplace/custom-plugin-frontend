## 💡 Tips for Success

### 1. **Code Along**
Type out examples instead of copy-pasting. This builds muscle memory.

### 2. **Build Projects**
Apply learning to real projects. Don't just read tutorials.

### 3. **Practice Consistently**
Learning frontend is like learning an instrument. Daily practice beats occasional long sessions.

### 4. **Join Communities**
