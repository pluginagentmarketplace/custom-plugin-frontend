- State Machines with XState
- Optimistic updates
- State hydration
- Server state vs client state

## ADVANCED
- Event-driven architecture
- Saga patterns
- CQRS implementation
- State machine composition
- Distributed state patterns
- Performance at scale

## Assets
- See `assets/state-architecture-config.yaml` for patterns
