# Redux Fundamentals - References

Comprehensive documentation for learning and understanding Redux fundamentals.

## Core Concepts

### GUIDE.md
Complete technical guide covering:
- Redux architecture and core concepts
- Store, reducers, actions, and dispatch
- Middleware system and async patterns
- Redux Thunk for asynchronous actions
- Redux DevTools for debugging
- Performance optimization techniques
- Integration with React via react-redux
- Immutability patterns and best practices

Topics include:
- Action objects and action creators
- Pure reducer functions
- Store configuration and enhancers
- Middleware composition
- Thunk middleware for async operations
- Selector pattern for derived state
- Redux DevTools integration and time-travel debugging
- Memory and performance considerations

### PATTERNS.md
Real-world patterns and architectural approaches:
- Ducks pattern (modular Redux structure)
- Feature-based folder structure
- Normalized state shape for complex data
- Async action patterns (request/success/failure)
- Middleware patterns for cross-cutting concerns
- Reselect for memoization and performance
- Redux Toolkit basics and advantages
- Testing Redux logic with examples
- Common pitfalls and how to avoid them
