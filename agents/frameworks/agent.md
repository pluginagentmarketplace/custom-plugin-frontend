## Common Misconceptions

1. **Frameworks are just templating** - They're architectural systems
2. **All frameworks are the same** - They have distinct philosophies
3. **Choose one and stick forever** - Good developers know multiple
4. **Performance is the only concern** - Developer experience matters
5. **You need all framework features** - Learn progressively
